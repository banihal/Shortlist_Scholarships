Born and bought up in Delhi, I am the only child of my parents. My father is a depression patient and is not able to contribute towards the family income. My mother is the only earning person. She works as a primary teacher but because of over dependency and pressure, she also takes tuition classes. 
I have completed my schooling from Mount Abu Public School. I was a student under economically weaker section category. I have been a bright student throughout, which reflects in my academic performance. I scored 9.6 CGPA in class 10th and stood as school topper, scoring 95.25% in class 12th. Along with education, I have been into extra-curricular activities such as dance, music, dramatics and debate and an active participant in various sports activities especially badminton.

I try to connect my passion for education with my desire of achieving my dreams, but as a sibling demands sunlight and water to nourish, similarly, I too need resources to achieve my dreams and goals. F&L scholarship programme is a great initiative to help students like me, who have an urge to achieve the heights in life but lack resources to achieve the same.I have been one of the lucky winners of scholarship for last past 2 years and for that I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the foundation.

I want to become most efficient civilengineer it's my dream.To achieve this I have to attend some seminars which involves some registration fee. Though, I got government fee reimbursement, I have to pay extra 40000rupees as college fee because my college fee is more, Which is very difficult to pay.

Seeing that from our childhood I and my younger brother wanted to read well and help him in future.. I got good score in state engineering entrance exam and got entry into good colleges , I got seat in universities outside my state also based on my +2 scores .. But my father was scared to send me far for my studies..I requested him and made him to join me in a university in Bangalore , this university management reduced my fee seeing my academics in previous schools.. Now I am studying engineering 2nd year, I need a laptop now.but I can't ask my father for money since he should pay fee for my brother and household affairs. I got a state first prize in election in my +2. I don't want to make my father feel all burden..I want to make use of my percentages , instead of just seeing them on papers.	Every engineer needs a laptop.. if I can get it by the scores of my academics, I will be very happy.. I can make my parents happy reducing a little burden on them..I want to take a yearbreak after engineering and pursue civils.. so I find that a laptop in my hand will be very useful for my studies

45272	In spite of being from a lower medium family, I continued my studies. As I done my 10th from my uncle's home and 12th by being there with my nani home due to my father's incapacity to pay for good and higher studies.It is too hard to be away from the parental guide at such a teen stage but I never left my hope. I thought if such a problem is going with me there must be some reason for my success. My mother always supported me and because of her strong trial by borrowing from the uncle she gave me a chance to pursue graduation from p.u, Patna. Just after the day of final exam(B.COM) I came to know that my mother became a mental patient and I continues myself with her treatment and left my studies for 2 years. I did part time for 6 months ,collected some money, pursuing MBA from Odisha by living there with one of my friend who always helped me. 	"After having such a critical life I dont want to die empty handed. I wanted to see a smile on my parents face, whom I have not seen From Last 1.5 years. I have taken an oath I will return my home only when I will get a job.But problems are chasing me continuously. I have no money for fees.I do not want that the last stage of my career would stop.Still, I have a hope that something can change the life.perhaps your scholarship up to a major extent. 
I wanted to bring a change in this society, who think inferior about a girl.I do not want a girl to continue her studies by living apart from her parents as its too difficult to tolerate the criticism of the society. "

53463	"My name is Nitya. I am pursuing B.Com (Hons.) final year from Shri Ram College of Commerce, Delhi University. I did my matriculation from Govt. Sarvodaya Co-Ed sr. sec. school, Poosangipur and higher secondary education from Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidhyalaya, Dwarka . 
 
As implied whole of my schooling is done from government schools only because of financial constraints. My family is an example of traditional culture where earning of one member goes on for feeding four mouths, that too hard earned money of a labour worker. 
 
I wanted to be a small fish in a big pond for a change. I knew getting admission in my dream college is an uphill battle. I gradually stopped my extra-curricular activities, including music and art lessons, and chose to study instead. I graduated at the top of my class and saw pride in eyes of my parents, which I craved for since ever. 
 
I was awarded with Rs. 1,00,000 scholarship for academic excellence from Govt. of India which helped me pay my college tuition fees. Ever since then I try to be financially independent, having received three scholarships of Rs. 12,000 during my graduation years from KPMG. 
 
I made my entry in corporate world by doing internship with Aditya Birla Money Mart. Although studies is my priority, I also try to brush up my skill set by becoming active member of college societies in creative wing. Presently I am learning to play guitar to quench my ever existing desire of learning something new. 
 
"	" “Do what you love, love what you do.” I found this quote while deciding my career aspirations. Pondering this, I found my answer for what I want to be. 
Presently, I am in final year of my graduation. Instead of choosing a potential job that will change time and time again as college placement, I need a long-term plan. My father insisted that I go for higher studies. He helped me gather all my courage and prepare for MBA 2017. 
Being a commerce student I know everything has a price, even my dreams. I am now preparing for CAT-2017 without coaching which is another uphill battle for me. Not taking coaching might prove to be a downfall for me having repercussions but I have got no choice. 
 If I get rewarded with “Fair & Lovely Foundation scholarship”, I will use the much needed amount to pay for my coaching and acquiring requisite knowledge for clearing the exam. For me, the scholarship amount will not be much chased after greed but the only way to reach my destination, my dreams. 
In the course of one lifetime, I want to be happy. Realizing this, the question, “What do you want to be?” might not provide the correct platform for my answer. Maybe the appropriate question for this answer is, “How do you want to exist”. I believe one day I will become a dynamic executive or a leader but I know it will be because I am happy doing it.

53980	"This is Ritika Mishra, pursuing B.com Hons final year from Hindu College, Delhi University. I completed my Secondary education from Govt Girls Sr. Sec School C-Block, Janakpuri and Higher Secondary from Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya, Dwarka. This successful journey of getting into a top college of India is all attributed to the firmness of my parents who always encouraged me to fight the odds and grow within grueling circumstances. 
My father, being the eldest among his siblings had to step down from his studies in mid to be a wage earner and with that, his dreams too. He is currently working laboriously as Operations Executive in Blue dart Express Limited to give his two daughters “Wings of Fire”. Even in today’s society, it’s difficult for a girl to realize her dreams due to the patriarchal thinking. My mother also had to quit teaching due to family issues. But I’m determined that I won’t let circumstances take control of me. Being a girl, becoming self-reliant and independent is always my priority. 
Unlike most people, I take pride in calling myself a Workaholic. I enjoy exploring new ideas, places and work; life is much richer when varied. Apart from studies, I’m also an active member of the Commerce society of my college. As my hobby, I do compositions in Hindi and English. I’ve also worked as a content writer intern with Rachna Sharma Foundation. 
I believe in perfection, for anything worth doing is worth doing well. 
 
 
"	"Getting into a top-notch institution isn’t something which sets you apart from others. What matters is how you exploit the forthcoming opportunities. Belonging to a lower middle class may restrict your thinking to get a degree first then a passive job and this vicious cycle goes on. But I have no plans to settle for less thus instead of hunting for a job with a basic pay, I want to pursue Management course from India’s top B-School by cracking CAT 2017. Those highly reputed people in elite suits have always allured me that is keeping me motivated for the upcoming entrance exam I’m preparing for. 
As success is born of struggle and an endless battle, this aspiration is also full of obstacles. The real achievement in life is if as a child, you can lessen the burden of your parents. No doubt, MBA is a big budget course so through the support of Fair and lovely Foundation, I expect to give my goals a much needed financial push. If I get this scholarship, I’ll be using it for paying my coaching fees to come up against this hypercompetitive exam. 
I want to come up to the expectations of my family and achieve self-reliance. This will be possible only if my efforts will be continuously supported. I believe that I’ll be true to the purpose and essence of this scholarship and will cherish my dreams to turn them into reality.

54324	My full name is Priyanka Maria DSouza. My strength is that I am a goal oriented and consistent individual, I can achieve my dreams and goals.I accept challenges and I complete them. My biggest challenge ever has been financial status. I live with my mother in Mangalore. My father expire in the year 2010 due to kidney failure. My mother does household work and has brought me upto this level. I studied in a kannada medium school upto 7th standard and always topped my class. 8th onwards i had a sponsor who joined me to English medium and I secured a 89.76% in my X Std. I got a merit seat at St Aloysius PU College for 12th Standard in Commerce-secured 95.67%(4th toper). Completed my B.Com from St Aloysius Evening College with 85.04% along with which I also completed CA-Inter Exams with 54.75% in Group I(Accountancy 73, Tax and Costing-53 each) and 55% in Group II(60 each in Advanced Accounting and Auditing and Assurance) 	I want to be a Chartered Accountant. A profession I've always dreamt of. As I said earlier, I completed IPCE(Inter) in 2014 and also completed my articleship, also registered for final course in 2014. But I've not been able to complete it as there aren't good coaching centres here and online coaching/going to another city for coaching is too costly/not affordable to me. I was thinking of keeping this dream on hold and going for a job though which I could earn for my family. At that time itself I saw the advertisement in the newspaper and it boosted me up for a while. I will definitely work and study, but if this scholarship is granted to me, I will be able to take coaching from best centers and complete CA Final very soon and become a CA with good marks. All in all, this scholarship is going to be of great help to me to add the 2 letters to my name and make it CA Priyanka Maria D'Souza.

54798	Respected Sir, According to “Sachar Committee” report the position of education in Muslim Minority is not so good. Especially the position of education in Muslim girls is not notable. The reason for it is that the Muslim parents are not ready to send their girls out of local palace for higher education. To contribute in the progress of India and to improve financial position of their family, it is necessary for Muslim Minority to improve their education, specially their higher education and its quality. For this it is necessary for Muslim girls to take education continuously for achieving their goal and for making their bright future without any obstruction. Keeping this situation into consideration in neglecting this all problems, I work hard in Bachelor of Computer Application and the god’s blessing and support, love and affection of my parents and teachers; I achieved good percentage (%) in Bachelor of Computer Application. Hence, I got admission in M.Sc. (CA & IT) I want to contribute in the valuable progress of my beloved India and also my society I completing M.Sc. (CA & IT)successfully and achieving goal to be the best Professor. The credit of this all goes to my parents who supported me and allowed me to for my higher education remaining far/away from my native place. Otherwise without their support and permission nothing was possible.	My parents have help me to study throughout Gujarati Medium in Govt. School. So financially it is somewhat harder to manage this all and I don’t want any more totally depend financially on my parents. My parents have responsibility me. So, I kindly request you to sanction my scholarship for successful education of M.Sc. (CA & IT) and which can also help financially to my parents. I hope it will be helpful for me to complete my M.Sc. (CA & IT) Course.

I was born and raised in Hyderabad, India.My father owns a business of dry cleaning.He had to look after all our basic needs,educational needs and others of 7 members. I learned from my father that a positive attitude, coupled with hard work, determines the success in the long run. 
As young kids, one of my sister and I were close friends but polar opposite characters. While I was analytical, academic, empathetic, experimental, she was outspoken, rebellious, confident and straight forward. Despite our differences, we always admired and influenced each other positively. I owe her for making me overcome my inhibitions and preparing me to face the life with a confident face. 
In college, I started getting involved in various extra-curricular activities and picked up interest in community activities, often bringing in a new perspective in the execution. Some of the notable involvement included - setting up a volunteer team,organizing a technological fair in the college, and organizing a blood donation camp in the community with more than 100 donors, including myself. 
"	" I got a chance to fulfill my wish of teaching the young kids in school, through volunteer participation in Junior Achievement wherein I have been teaching elementary students basics of maths and science for the last five years. 
I look forward to bring in my values of positive attitude, hard work, enthusiasm, differential thinking and willingness to learn in the class and make the class a forum of active ideas exchange. I am not seeking a mere B.ed, but a lifetime bonding with fellow students and professors that will extend beyond classroom."

To complete my education till now my father worked a lot . And even I struggled a lot to be a doctor .I studied in kittur rani chennamma school on the merit basis, i.e., after getting selected into written exam then interview, I secured 14th rank among 5000 students who appeared in the exam. As I scored 94.08% in 10th board exam I got into 'Alvas educational foundation college.,moodbidri' as an adopted student I.e., freeseat in my PU course. Then I got medical seat in government college of medical science in belgavi. 
Since I admitted in my 1st year exam time I got 6 month lag by just 1 mark, which dragged me into depression. After that I took it as a challenge and completed all my phases in 1st attempt with first class division in all years. Even I got 2nd rank in my whole class in all my successive years of my bachelor's degree. Although this has empowered my confidence in a right path. 
Not only in study I am also good at sports. In my school and colleges I used to play basketball in district level and even I know to ride a horse. These all are my hobbies. 
"	" When I heard about this scholarship through my friend. After receiving such an opportunity I thought that even a girl from economically backward house can pursue her higher studies. Despite of struggle in my life, this scholarship may act as a candle towards my ambitions. 
 In my family I have 3 siblings so even they are all in school and getting educated. As my father who is considered as 'the backbone of Indian economy ' I.e., a farmer made me to have my own opinion regarding choosing my career in medical field and also helped and supported in all my decisions. 
 I want to continue my education in higher studies i.e., post graduation for which I need 4 lakh per year as fees every year which will become a very big burden on my father as I am not alone child. I need government seat from state quota has fees is around 4 lakh . That is the reason for applying this scholarship. 
 Hoping that this fair and lovely foundation will help in my higher studies which will be very useful for my career and my life. Kindly provide me this scholarship. So that I can reach my goal or ambitions with the help of this foundation and serve many more needy people.
